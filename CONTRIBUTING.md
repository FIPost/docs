# Contributing

Currently this project is being developed by semester 6 software students of the FHICT. Because this project is larger than most and should end up in production, it is important that everything is well documented. Even though the project will be managed by PT groups, every bit of help is appreciated and everyone who is willing to help out is welcome.

### <a name="Members">For members</a>

The project is being developed with an Agile proces. We work in sprints of three weeks in which we deliver User Stories. These are decided in accordance with the Product Owner. The User Stories itself are written from the perspective of the user and mostly contain functionality in a vertical line from front- to backend. To manage this proces we use [Azure Boards](https://dev.azure.com/405273/IPost/)

Contact us to become a main member of the project.

#### Branch name
Each branch should be related to a user story of our sprint board.
The branch should be named according to the following format:
- `#{backlog-item-nr}-{short-title}`

##### Example
![user-story-img](./assets/user-story.png)

Branch name: `#53-finish-button`

### Commit Policy
- Commits must have describing titles.
